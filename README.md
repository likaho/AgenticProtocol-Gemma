# Agentic Protocol 
Welcome to Agentic Protocol - An open platform for the new AI economy.  It is a Decentralized Agentic Protocol No-Code Building Tool & Marketplace.

## Overview

- This innovative platform empowers creators and developers to build and own their AI agents.
  

### There are five main directories in this repo:

  

1.  **chat-ui**: This folder is dedicated to the chat web client.

2.  **llm-server**: This folder contains an Express web service that handles requests from llm-proxy-server service. It forwards prompts to the Galadriel network.

3.  **agents**: Here, you'll find all agents using DataGemma.

4.  **ai-app-builder**: The ai-app-builder folder includes both client and server-side projects. It provides a no-code agent building tool and serves as the marketplace.

5.  **llm-proxy-server**: In this folder, you'll find Python scripts responsible for function calling. They act as a proxy, deciding which tool or agent to call or redirecting calls to the Gemma2 27B model.

  
  

## Technologies Were Used

The project leverages three key components: Filecoin, Citrea, and the Galadriel network.

### Quick Tutorial - Custom LLM Flow Registration

- **Agent Discovery and Tool Use:**
  - Finally, a new chat flow acts like a tool for other agents after it is listed in the marketplace. It will be automatically discovered. LLMs can benefit from tool use to perform more complex tasks. Tools allow LLMs to trigger actions.

### Agent Inference

The user prompt is transmitted to our marketplace, where the appropriate tool or tools are selected to fulfill the request.

### Running the Project
  

1. Clone the repository
  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/likaho/AgenticProtocol-Gemma.git

```

  

2. Go into individual directory, create .env file 


- Go into ai-app-builder/packages/server/ directory


```bash

cd AgenticProtocol/ai-app-builder/packages/server/
cp .env.example .env

```


 - Edit .env file

- Go into ai-app-builder/packages/ui/ directory


```bash

cd AgenticProtocol/ai-app-builder/packages/ui/
cp .env.example .env

```


- Go into llm-proxy-server directory


```bash

cd AgenticProtocol/llm-proxy-server
cp .env.example .env

```



- Go into llm-server directory

```bash

cd AgenticProtocol/llm-server
cp .env.example .env

```

  

3. Start the apps and services:

  

```bash

cd AgenticProtocol-Gemma
docker-compose up -d

```

  

You can now access the AI builder app on [http://localhost:3031](http://localhost:3031)
- Username: user
- Password: 1234


And chat-ui on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
